# Fivestar Restaurant

A small restaurant website built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**.
It uses `react-bootstrap` for layout/components and `react-router-dom` for client‑side
routing. The demo app has pages for home, menu, staff, delivery options, and a contact
form, plus a 404 page and a responsive navbar.

> 🚀 This project was bootstrapped from the official Vite React + TypeScript template.
